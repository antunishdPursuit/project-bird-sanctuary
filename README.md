## Overview
This project is a Bird Sanctuary Adoption App built using React, **Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS**. The app allows users to view a collection of adoptable birds, each with a name, image, and price. 

Users can add birds to their shopping cart, which updates the total cost dynamically. If the cart contains three or more birds, a 10% discount is applied. Additionally, users can earn bonus items based on their cart total, with bonus tiers ranging from 1 to 4 items depending on the purchase amount.

The cart functionality includes the ability to remove birds and updates the displayed list of adopted birds in real-time. A checkout form enables users to complete their purchase, resetting the cart upon successful submission with a confirmation alert. 

Data for the birds and bonus items is stored in separate files (birds.js and bonusItems.js). *The project incorporates modern front-end technologies like React for state management and interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsive styling.*
